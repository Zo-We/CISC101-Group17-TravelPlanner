### **Module 2 — Plan Builder (Options → Days)**

**Change Log (2025-11-14):**
**Added a rule to make sure that each day must includes at least one indoor activity option for weather flexibility.**

Create a short list of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks).  
Each activity includes type, estimated duration, cost range, and distance.

Use a simple loop to build days:

for each day:  
    pick Morning activity (near lodging)  
    pick Midday activity (close by)  
    pick Afternoon activity (different theme)  
    pick Evening restaurant or optional event
    Each day must include at least one indoor activity for example museum, cafe, gallery, or indoor market. So the trip remains workable during unexpected weather changes.
